# virtual-board
The Virtual-Board is a tool which uses hand gestures being monitored by an 
inbuilt system webcam or an external one, thus enabling the user to directly write upon the 
screen of system virtually without making use of any additional gadgets like light pen or any 
pen-tab type of format.
It involves three different types of ink pen support namely red (by default), blue and black 
along with an eraser, in case if you want to erase some written text or any drawing on screen.
As we know that the world around us is progressing rapidly and so the need to improvement 
in what facilities we all are availing and want to achieve.
In 21st century Education is the very much needed thing that is to be availed by everyone and 
each and every individual wants to learn something new and thus want to implement it in a 
way or so. We all came from an era where the educational content is delivered on a black 
board and teacher uses chalk and duster to basically write or erase anything on it respectively.
As our lives had progressed we came to know about projector, light pen-tab setup, visionary 
displays, these all are technologies helpful in providing a better way of content delivery to the 
groups or masses without getting all your hands and cloths dirty from the dust of chalk.
There can be other possible solution to for the problem i.e., a Virtual Board. A software 
interface that could provide the better content delivering experience to the faculty at ease.
This makes use of webcam to detect the hand gestures and thus anyone will be able to write 
or erase onscreen content within a particular area of reach.
The webcam detects palm gestures to identify that either you are in selective mode or in 
action mode based upon the finger positions.
